Hey all my name is Jamaal Mohamed im a 23 yr old college student who is fascinated about technology and business and ispired by Steve Jobs. I've always wanted to get into coding but was too intimitated and this is my first time learning about it. Heres to much success to all of us becoming better at coding. Hopefully one day soon i'll be able to master this and finally come out with my fitness meal prep app.
